/**
 * Guards for outgoing server-side requests (CWE-918 / "request forgery").
 *
 * Several routes accept a URL from the request body, from a `Location` header,
 * or from a database row and then fetch it. If that value is not constrained,
 * the caller can aim the server at internal services -- cloud metadata, a
 * cluster-internal admin API -- and any credential attached to the request
 * (a session cookie) is delivered to whatever host was chosen.
 *
 * The rule applied here: a URL that came from outside this process is only ever
 * used after its host has been checked against an explicit allow-list, and only
 * over HTTPS so a validated host cannot be downgraded to a cleartext listener.
