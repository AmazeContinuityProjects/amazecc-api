 * ## What is stored, and what is not
 *
 * Three tables, and none of them holds a mark:
 *
 * | Table | Holds | Per student? |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `class_overall_stats` | `count`, `mean`, `m2` per class | no |
 * | `class_assessment_stats` | `count`, `mean`, `m2` per (class, assessment) | no |
 * | `class_user_marks` | `value_token` — an HMAC of the mark | yes, but not the mark |
 *
 * `value_token` is what replaces the previous `class_user_hashes.last_updated_at` scheme.
 * Welford's remove step needs to know what a student previously contributed, so the student
 * *tells* us (`prevMark`) and we check the claim against a token we minted last time. The
 * client cannot forge one — the HMAC key is server-only — and the mark is never written.
 *
 * This is why there is no `mark` column: a 0–100 value is a 101-element domain, so even a
 * plain hash of one would be reversible by brute force in microseconds. An HMAC under a
 * server-only salt is not, because the client never holds the key and never sees a token.
 *
 * The consequence is the one the UI's privacy copy depends on: an individual's contribution
 * exists only in the request body and in the accumulator. It is never persisted.

 *
 * ## Why a plain SHA-256 and not `maskUserID`
 *
 * This has to be computable on **both** sides. The client reads the statistics back and
 * has to line each one up with the assessment it is rendering, and it cannot compute an
 * HMAC under a server-only salt. So the key is a plain digest of a course-level constant —
 * "Embedded Theory :: Continuous Assessment Test 1" — which is identical for every student
 * in the cohort and published in the course scheme anyway.
 *
 * There is nothing here to protect: the string is not user data. What the digest does buy
 * is that VTOP's raw markup never lands in a column, and that the two halves of an embedded
 * course cannot collide. The value that *is* sensitive — an individual's mark — never
 * reaches the database at all; see `valueToken`.

 *
 * ## Reconciling the old scheme (`reconciled`)
 *
 * Contributions recorded before this design carry no token — they were keyed on an
 * unsalted browser hash of the login ID. When such a student first contributes through
 * the new path, the server would otherwise `add` alongside their old point and count
 * them twice. If the caller supplies `reconcile` and the VTOP-verified register number
 * matches the claimed login ID (case-insensitively — the standard case, since the app
 * saves the credentials the student types), the server probes the legacy hashes for a
 * matching record. On a hit, the stated `prevMark` is removed before the new mark is
 * added, exactly as a token match would do.
 *
 * The gate matters: without the ID match, any authenticated student could name any
 * legacy record and distort it. With it, the reconciliation can only ever touch the
 * caller's own old contribution — the only `(class, hash)` pair producible from their
 * own login ID. Nonstandard accounts (username ≠ regNo) find no match and fall through
 * to a plain `add`; their ghost persists, bounded and documented, until term rollover.
